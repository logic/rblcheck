<Chapter id="about">
<Title>About rblcheck</Title>
<Para>
rblcheck is a very basic interface to
<ULink url="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/">RBL</ULink>-style
DNS listings such as those operated by the
<ULink url="http://mail-abuse.org/">MAPS</ULink> and
<ULink url="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</ULink> projects.
</Para>

<Para>
The general idea behind RBL-style listings is rapid lookup of IP
addresses using DNS (for example, for blacklisting IP addresses because
of abuse). Each IP address is reversed and has a domain name attached to
it; for example, the IP address 127.0.0.2 would become 2.0.0.127, and then
a domain such as "blackholes.mail-abuse.org" would be added to it. You
would then try to resolve the result (ie. 2.0.0.127.blackholes.mail-abuse.org);
if you receive a positive reply, then you know that the address is listed.
Further information can also be queried, such as text descriptions of why
the address was listed.

<Title>Compiling</Title>

<Para>
Before building rblcheck, edit the file <Filename>sites.h</Filename> for
the listings you wish to check against (to un-comment a listing, remove
the <ComputerOutput>/*</ComputerOutput> and <ComputerOutput>*/</ComputerOutput>
around the <ComputerOutput>SITE(...)</ComputerOutput> line).
</Para>

<Para>
To compile rblcheck, just run <Application>./configure</Application> in
the main directory, followed by <Application>make</Application> when the
first command is complete.
</Para>

<Para>
To make sure that what you now have works correctly, run <Application>make
check</Application>; make sure that you have an Internet connection handy when
you do, or a large number of the tests will produce (non-fatal) failures.
</Para>

<Para>
When you are done, you can type <Application>make install</Application> to
install the software (by default, everything will be installed in
<Filename>/usr/local</Filename>.
</Para>

<Para>
For more details on how the <Application>configure</Application> command
works, please see the file <Filename>INSTALL</Filename> in the main directory,
which has a complete breakdown of all of your options.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="building_developers">
<Title>Note to developers</Title>

<Para>
If you see a script called
<Application>bootstrap</Application> in the main directory, then you are
using a development release, and you will need a few extra tools to compile
rblcheck. Specifically, you will need to make sure that autoconf and
automake are installed correctly on your system before you can build. Once
you have satisfied those requirements, please run
<Application>./bootstrap</Application> from the main directory before
running the <Application>./configure</Application> script mentioned above.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="building_distributors">
<Title>Note to distributors</Title>

<Para>
I highly recommend leaving everything commented out
in <Filename>sites.h</Filename>; this was really only added as a convenience
mechanism for personal builds, not for a distributor to

than you think; let them make up their own mind.

<Para>
When invoked, rblcheck returns either 0 (to indicated error, or that the
address was not in any of the listings), or a positive number (indicating
the number of listings that the IP address was found in).

<Para>
To verify that the program is working after you've compiled it, try the
following test:
</Para>

<Screen>$ ./rblcheck -s blackholes.mail-abuse.org 127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1 not RBL filtered by blackholes.mail-abuse.org
$ ./rblcheck -s blackholes.mail-abuse.org 127.0.0.2
127.0.0.2 RBL filtered by blackholes.mail-abuse.org</Screen>

<Para>
If you see any other result than the above, then something has gone wrong;
please see below about reporting bugs and finding help.
</Para>

<Para>
You can check multiple addresses at once, to make life a little easier
with scripts; just add additional addresses on the command line after all
of the options. By specifying an address of "-", rblcheck will read from
stdin and perform a lookup on every line of input (if it is a valid IP
address).
</Para>
</Chapter>

<Chapter id="thirdparty">
<Title>Third-Party Software</Title>
<Para>
rblcheck works well as a command-line tool for performing lookups, but it
also serves an important role working with other software, such as mail
servers and email filtering programs.
</Para>

<Section id="thirdparty_procmail">
<Title>Procmail</Title>

<Para>
rblcheck was really designed to be used with procmail, as long as you have
access to the IP address of the system sending you email. Surprisingly,
most MTAs make obtaining this information more difficult than it needs to
be. The procmail rule I present here assumes you've found some way to put
the IP address of the sender in the variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
See the sections below on Sendmail and QMail for ideas on how you can get
ahold of this value.
</Para>

<Para>
The following procmail rule will, once you have <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>,
use rblcheck to look up the IP address in the built-in filters:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>:0
* ! ? if [ -n "$TCPREMOTEIP" ]; then rblcheck -q "$TCPREMOTEIP"; fi
{
	EXITCODE=100
	LOGABSTRACT=all
	LOG="Filter: RBL-filtered address: \"$TCPREMOTEIP\"
"
	:0:
	$FILTER_FOLDER
}</ProgramListing>

<Para>
<EnVar>FILTERFOLDER</EnVar> is assumed to have been set up ahead of
time as the place to put email that you don't want to see (either another
incoming folder, /dev/null, or a 'formail' invokation that rewrites the
message and tacks on an extra header or munges the subject so you can
easily identify it.
</Para>

<Para>
Note that <EnVar>EXITCODE</EnVar> above is for QMail, and indicates a
permanent error. Under Sendmail, 77 is more appropriate. Under anything
else, it's hard to say; your best bet is to refer to the documentation
regarding execution of programs.
</para>

<Para>
One more thing: procmail has a nasty habit of munging the environment, but
most MTAs already do this for you. Hence, you should add the '-p' flag to
the invokation of procmail (either from a local delivery rule in Sendmail,
or from a .forward or .qmail file). This will ensure that procmail doesn't
clean out the value of <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>.
</Para>

<Para>
To test the procmail recipe:
</Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Save any mail message, with full headers, to a file.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to an offending address, and with the message you just saved as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.2 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message went through,
you have a problem. If you have a message in your logfile stating
that the message was bounced for being in the RBL, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Run procmail with the environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar> set
to a non-filtered address, such as 127.0.0.1, and with the message as input:
<Screen>cat message | env - TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.1 procmail -p</Screen>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Check your procmail log and mailbox. If the message didn't go
through, you have a problem. If you have a copy of the message in
your mailbox, and no errors in your log file, you're fine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</OrderedList>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_sendmail">
<Title>Sendmail</Title>

<Para>
This solution for obtaining the IP address of the connecting host could be
considered to be a bit of a hack, but it works quite reliably. If you're
an ordinary user on your system, you won't be able to use this; talk to
your system administrator about the possibility of installing the
sendmail.cf patch below. Point them at this file as a source of
information.
</Para>

<Para>
Currently, in your sendmail.cf file, you'll probably have something like:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
Or, if you're using procmail as the local delivery agent:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@ShPfn, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=procmail -a $h -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This is the local delivery rule used to execute .forward scripts.  Your
system might use something like <Application>rsh</Application> or another
restricted shell instead of <Application>sh</Application> for running
programs. Don't let that scare you; they all basically work the same.
</Para>

<Para>
Change the above lines to look like this (there will also be Mprog lines
which look similar; you can modify them in exactly the same manner):
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Mlocal,	P=/usr/bin/env, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@SnE, S=10/30, R=20/40,
	T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
	A=env TCPREMOTEIP="${client_addr}" mail -f $g -d $u
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
(replacing "mail -f $g -d $u" with "procmail -a $h -d $u" appropriately.)
</Para>

<Para>
ONLY change the P=... and A=... entries. Most certainly do not mess with
F=... unless you know what you are doing.
</Para>

<Para>
This will create an environment variable <EnVar>TCPREMOTEIP</EnVar>, which
you can now use with rblcheck to determine if the address has been blocked.
To test this, set up an alias like:
</Para>

<Screen>foo: |mailx -s "$TCPREMOTEIP" user@domain.com</Screen>

<Para>
Then, send email to the alias "foo" (or whatever). You should
immediately get a piece of email with the IP address which sent the
message in the subject line. (Replace <Application>mailx</Application>
with <Application>mail</Application> on some systems.)
</Para>

<Para>
This is about the most efficient means of getting this information to
executed programs that I can see with sendmail. What would -really- be
nice here would be a way to program how Sendmail sets up the environment
before executing an external program, at the point of execution. Bug the
Sendmail developers if you agree with me. ;-)
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_qmail">
<Title>QMail</Title>

<Para>
Getting this going under QMail turns out to be a real challenge, since
QMail doesn't have the same level of programmability that Sendmail has.
Hence, we need to employ an additional script to grab the IP address from
the headers. (Thanks to Russell Nelson for confirming QMail's behavior
here.)
</Para>

<Para>
QMail has a very specific means of adding Received: lines to messages,
making them relatively easy to parse. For example, the following headers
are typical:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
Return-Path: &lt;emarshal@xnet.com&gt;
Delivered-To: emarshal@LOGIC.NET
Received: (qmail 26029 invoked from network); 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
Received: from quake.xnet.com (HELO mail.xnet.com) (198.147.221.35)
  by labyrinth.logic.net with SMTP; 13 Oct 1997 15:04:13 -0000
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
We can disregard the Return-Path: and Delivered-To: lines; they're
unimportant to us. The Received: headers are the most interesting. The
first Received: line we'll see is the local delivery of the mail; hence,
the "qmail 2609 invoked from network". The second Received: line is the
most important to us; it's the one which contains the IP address of the
sender...in this case, 198.147.221.35. To complicate things, the "(HELO
mail.xnet.com)" section may not exist, and the IP address might have ident
information prepended to it (like "qmailr@198.147.221.35").
</Para>

<Para>
Two programs are provided to help you retrieve this information
automatically from the headers, both with the same semantics. "origip.c"
compiles into "origip", and for those who have trouble compiling it (if
you do, please email me with any errors), "origip.awk" is provided which
behaves the same way.
</Para>

<Para>
Essentially, you pass either of these programs an email message, and they
in turn extract the sending address and either print it back to you, or
exit with a non-zero return value.
</Para>

<Para>
To use this in procmail, just use:
</Para>

<Screen>TCPREMOTEIP=`origip || echo 127.0.0.1`</Screen>

<Para>
This will pipe the message through origip (replace origip with
"origip.awk" in the case of using the awk script), and will capture the
address. If there is an error, we'll default to 127.0.0.1, which will
allow the mail through.
</Para>

<Para>
(If you're undecided which program of the two you want to use, consider
that the C version is much faster, and will be maintained more than the
awk script. However, the C version is probably more prone to bugs. ;-)
</Para>

<Para>
Once you have that line in place, go ahead and use the procmail recipe
supplied above in good health.
</Para>
</Section>

<Section id="thirdparty_ident_smtpd">
<Title>inetd and smtpd</Title>

<Para>
If you use an smtp server which runs from inetd (sendmail can operate this
way, as can QMail and a number of other MTAs), here's a good way to do
site-wide filtering using rblcheck; add the following to /etc/hosts.allow:
</Para>

<ProgramListing>
smtpd: ALL: spawn /usr/local/bin/rblcheck -q %a &amp;&amp; \
	exec /usr/local/bin/smtpd || /bin/echo \
	"469 Connection refused. See http://maps.vix.com/rbl/\r\b\r\n"
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
This gives you RBL support on a site-wide basis, even if native support
doesn't yet exist for your MTA of choice. This assumes that your inetd has
support for tcp_wrappers checks; many Linux variants fall into this
category, but other platforms may differ.
</Para>

<Para>
A word of warning, however: there are a number of very good reasons to not
run a production mail server from inetd, which I won't elaborate on here.  
You might want to investigate more secure and reliable alternatives, such
as tcpserver from D. J. Bernstein's excellent
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</ULink> package.
</Para>

<Para>
Don't ask me. If you figure out a way to make this work under another
setup, let me know how you did it, and I'll add it here. If you find

and you'll see your idea show up in here in the next release.

<Title>...or Not To Do?</Title>

<Para>
These are the features that you'll never see in the version of rblcheck
that I produce (rblcheck is GPL; you're free to produce your own version
if this doesn't suit you well), and the rationale behind why not. I'm
hoping that the explainations will make sense, but I'm always open to
criticism if you feel my logic is flawed.
</Para>

<VariableList>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Support for doing lookups of FQDNs</Term>
<ListItem><Para>
This is a futile method of checking whether a particular system is
blackholed; if the originating system has control of reverse DNS for
their IP space, they can make their IP address resolve to anything
they want, such as system.network.com. If rblcheck were to do a lookup
on that, "system.network.com" might resolve to anything (such as
"127.0.0.1, which will always pass with every currently known
RBL-based blacklist). A compromise that I've considered would be
similar to TCP Wrapper's system of multiple lookups: take the IP
address, look up the reverse, then resolve the reverse to an IP
address. If both lookups match, then proceed, otherwise exit with a
failure. I'd consider integrating code from someone who implemented
this behavior.
</Para></ListItem>

<ListItem><Para>
What do you do with your scripts when the blacklist order changes, or new
blacklists appear (assuming a dynamic assignment of identifiers)?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
If you hard-code a number for each and every blacklist, who becomes
responsible for being a registry for those numerical identifiers? What
happens to already-assigned values when blacklists shutdown or change
incompatibly?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
How do you scale beyond 256 RBL services? With the advent of software such as
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/rbldns.html">rbldns</ULink> (a part of the
<ULink url="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</ULink> package which allows
anyone to host an RBL-style service), and with nearly a dozen
<ULink url="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</ULink> domains alone, does this
limitation seem reasonable?
</Para></ListItem>
<ListItem><Para>
How do you report multiple matches with a return code, when the return code
can only hold one number?
</Para></ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>
Some of these can be solved, but not cleanly; you'll need no end of special
cases to accomodate them.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Integrated scanning of email and similar features</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
    This is a question of UNIX philosophy: design one tool for one task,
    and do it well. There are plenty of far more powerful text parsing
    tools available which are more appropriate for the job (email parsing
    is easily handled by tools such as formail, general text parsing is
    better suited by tools such as sed, awk, perl, python, etc), and they
    can do a much better job than something that I could integrate into
    rblcheck while still maintaining a small footprint.

  <title>GNU General Public License</title>

  <sect1 id="gpl-preamble">
    <title>Preamble</title>
    
    <para>
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
      to your programs, too.
    </para>

    <para>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
      programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </para>

    <para>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
      copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
      must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </para>

    <para>
      We protect your rights with two steps:

      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    copyright the software, and
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
	    distribute and/or modify the software.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
      reputations.
    </para>

    <para>
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    </para>

    <para>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
      follow.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="gpl-terms">
    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</title>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect0">
      <title>Section 0</title>
      <para>
	This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
	placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
	of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
	program or work, and a <quote>work based on the Program</quote> means either 
	the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
	work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
	modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
	is included without limitation in the term <quote>modification</quote>.) Each 
	licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
	this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
	restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running 
	the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect1">
      <title>Section 1</title>
      <para>
	You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
	publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
	keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
	warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
	along with the Program.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at 
	your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect2">
      <title>Section 2</title>
      <para>
	You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
	forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
	or work under the terms of <link linkend="gpl-sect1">Section 1</link> above, provided 
	that you also meet all of these conditions:

	<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
	      you changed the files and the date of any change.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or 
	      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
	      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
	      this License.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
	      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
	      ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
	      copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying 
	      that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
	      under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
	      License. 

	      <note>
		<title>Exception:</title>
		<para>
		  If the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an 
		  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an 
		  announcement.) 
		</para>
	      </note>

	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
	of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
	independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
	do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when 
	you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
	Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
	permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and 
	every part regardless of who wrote it.
      </para>

      <para>
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights 
	to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
	the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program 
	(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
	does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect3">
      <title>Section 3</title>

      <para>
	You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
	<link linkend="gpl-sect2">Section 2</link> in object code or executable form under the terms of 
	<link linkend="gpl-sect1">Sections 1</link> and <link linkend="gpl-sect2">2</link> above provided that 
	you also do one of the following:

	<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
	      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
	      customarily used for software interchange; or,
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any 
	      third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source 
	      distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, 
	      to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily 
	      used for software interchange; or,
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
	      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
	      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form 
	      with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
	to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
	it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
	compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
	code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
	binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
	on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
	designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
	counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
	copy the source along with the object code.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect4">
      <title>Section 4</title>
      
      <para>
	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
	under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
	Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, 
	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
	licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect5">
      <title>Section 5</title>

      <para>
	You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing 
	else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
	These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying 
	or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
	of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
	modifying the Program or works based on it.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect6">
      <title>Section 6</title>

      <para>
	Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient 
	automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
	the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
	on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
	compliance by third parties to this License.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect7">
      <title>Section 7</title>

      <para>
	If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other 
	reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
	agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you 
	from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
	your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
	you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
	royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
	indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
	to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, 
	the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply 
	in other circumstances.
      </para>

      <para>
	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property 
	right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
	protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public 
	license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
	distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up 
	to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
	system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
      </para>

      <para>
	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the 
	rest of this License.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gpl-sect8">
      <title>Section 8</title>

      <para>
	If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents 
	or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
	distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
	incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

	in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </para>

      <para>
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of 
	this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms 
	and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
	Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any

      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
      their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.

    <para>
      This License is a kind of <quote>copyleft</quote>, which means
      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same
      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited
      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works
      whose purpose is instruction or reference.

      Foundation</ulink> may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
      Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
      in detail to address new problems or concerns. See <ulink

      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the <link linkend="fdl-document">Document</link>
      specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
      <quote>or any later version</quote> applies to it, you have the
      option of following the terms and conditions either of that
      specified version or of any later version that has been
      published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If
      the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
      you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by
      the Free Software Foundation.

      choice of free software license, such as the <ulink type="http"
      url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"> GNU General Public
